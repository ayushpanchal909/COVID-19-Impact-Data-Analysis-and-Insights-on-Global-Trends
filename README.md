## Covid-19-Analysis

In my project, I started by bringing in COVID-19 data from a CSV file. After that, I worked on cleaning and organizing the data. This helped me get rid of any errors and make sure the information was accurate. 

Then, I created a special kind of chart called a treemap. This chart made it easy to see which country had the most total COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. It's like a visual representation of the numbers.

I also made a different type of chart called a line chart. This kind of chart showed the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths over time. This way, I could see how the situation changed as time went on.

For another chart, I used a bar chart. This showed the ratio between a country's population and the number of COVID-19 cases. It helped me understand which countries were more affected based on their population size.

I did something similar for countries that were hit hard by COVID-19. I made a bar chart to show which countries were most affected. This gave me an idea of where the virus had the biggest impact.

I also calculated two more ratios - the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases and the ratio of serious cases to deaths. These ratios were shown in bar charts as well.

Finally, I focused on two specific countries: Brazil and the United States. I made a line chart to show how the number of COVID-19 cases changed in these countries.

In summary, my project involved importing COVID-19 data, cleaning it up, and creating different types of charts to understand the impact of the virus. I used treemaps, line charts, and bar charts to visualize the data and draw insights.
