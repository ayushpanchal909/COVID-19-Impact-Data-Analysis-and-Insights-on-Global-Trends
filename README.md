## Covid-19-Analysis

In my project, I started by bringing in COVID-19 data from a CSV file. After that, I worked on cleaning and organizing the data. This helped me get rid of any errors and make sure the information was accurate. 

Then, I created a special kind of chart called a treemap. This chart made it easy to see which country had the most total COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. It's like a visual representation of the numbers.

I also made a different type of chart called a line chart. This kind of chart showed the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths over time. This way, I could see how the situation changed as time went on.

For another chart, I used a bar chart. This showed the ratio between a country's population and the number of COVID-19 cases. It helped me understand which countries were more affected based on their population size.

I did something similar for countries that were hit hard by COVID-19. I made a bar chart to show which countries were most affected. This gave me an idea of where the virus had the biggest impact.

I also calculated two more ratios - the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases and the ratio of serious cases to deaths. These ratios were shown in bar charts as well.

Finally, I focused on two specific countries: Brazil and the United States. I made a line chart to show how the number of COVID-19 cases changed in these countries.

In summary, my project involved importing COVID-19 data, cleaning it up, and creating different types of charts to understand the impact of the virus. I used treemaps, line charts, and bar charts to visualize the data and draw insights.

### Objective of Analysis
>Which country shows the highest number of active COVID-19 cases in relation to their total cases, total deaths, and total recovered cases?

>Which countries have a higher ratio of COVID-19 tests conducted relative to their population size?

>Which countries are prominently represented across all four categories: confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, and active cases, indicating a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic?

>How do the countries' ratios of deaths to confirmed cases compare with their ratios of tests conducted to confirmed cases, and are there any notable trends or patterns among these ratios?

>How has the trajectory of COVID-19 cases evolved over time in Brazil and the United States, and are there any points of divergence or similarity between the two countries?

The data reveals significant variations in COVID-19 testing rates across countries. Bangladesh and Pakistan stand out with remarkably high ratios, while the US and UK exhibit moderate ratios. These differences highlight distinct testing strategies and their potential impact on case identification and management.
